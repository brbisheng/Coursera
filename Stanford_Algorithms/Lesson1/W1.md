1. decompose the random variable C(σ), where C is defined as the number of comparions between any two elements in the array.
    - x_{i,j} as the individual random variable between two elements from the **unsorted** array.
    - z_{i,j} as the individual random variable between two elements from the **sorted** array.
  
2. Consider A = z_{i}, z_{i+1}, ..., z_{j-1}, z{j}.
    - When z_{i} or z_{j} is picked, these two get compared.
    - When any element in the array A other that z_{i} or z_{j} is picked, z_{i} and z_{j} never get compared again.

3. E(z_{i,j}]) = 2/(j-i+1)

4. E(C) is bounded
    - E(C) <= 2 * (n-1) * sum_{k}(1/k)

My hint for problem set 3.

1. the sample space of the random variable is {1, 2, ..., floor(n/2)}. Assuming n is even, the corresponding probability is 2/n, ...,
    - 2/n is the probability of each sample point
    - n/2 and α * n are respectively the upper and lower bound.

2. Not sure how to interpret it.

4. This is a classical problem: the key is that the probability that a randomly selected pair has the same birthday is 1/365, instead of 1/365^2.

5. think about a simple dice with sample space {1,2,3}, the result should carry through.
