1. decompose the random variable C(Ïƒ), where C is defined as the number of comparions between any two elements in the array.
  - x_{i,j} as the individual random variable between two elements from the **unsorted** array.
  - z_{i,j} as the individual random variable between two elements from the **sorted** array.
  
2. Consider A = z_{i}, z_{i+1}, ..., z_{j-1}, z{j}.
  - When z_{i} or z_{j} is picked, these two get compared.
  - When any element in the array A other that z_{i} or z_{j} is picked, z_{i} and z_{j} never get compared again.

3. E(z_{i,j}]) = 2/(j-i+1)

4. E(C) is bounded
  - E(C) <= 2 * (n-1) * sum_{k}(1/k)
